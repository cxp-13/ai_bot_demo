## Project Overview

This is a simple AI-controlled smart contract project built with Golang, integrating Wit.Ai for natural language processing and intent recognition.

## Technology Stack

- **Golang**: Chosen as the primary programming language for its high performance and concurrency support.
- **Wit.Ai**: Used for natural language processing and intent recognition, integrated with the `wit-go` library.
- **Solidity**: Utilized for writing and deploying smart contracts, controlling and managing an NFT marketplace on the blockchain.
- **Ethereum**: Interacted with via the `go-ethereum` and `ethgo` libraries for communication with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Gin**: A high-performance HTTP web framework used for building APIs.
- **Redis**: Employed the `go-redis` library for caching and storing private keys and other data.
- **GJSON**: Used for parsing and processing JSON data.
- **Godotenv**: Used for loading environment variables, facilitating local development and configuration management.

## Features

- Parsing natural language queries from users.
- Utilizing Wit.Ai for intent recognition and extraction of key entities.
- Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts for NFT marketplace operations.
- Caching private keys and other data with Redis to improve performance.
- Providing a RESTful API implemented with Gin for receiving and handling requests.
